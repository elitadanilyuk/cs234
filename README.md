This is the folder for CSC234 (C++ Programming (Platform)) at Front Range Community College.

Starts with basic differences between C++ and other programming languages and progresses to programming advanced C++ concepts such as operator overloading, friends, references, namespaces, pointers and dynamic arrays, templates, streams and file I/O, recursion, polymorphism, exception handling and Standard Template Library. The course covers large programs that are coded implementing object-oriented design principles such as classes and objects, polymorphism, encapsulation, composition, inheritance and templates.
